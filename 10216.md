## Task Description ##

We fill an N by N matrix with 1, 2, …, $N^2$ by the following steps.
First, fill the initial position in the grid with the number 1. 
After that, fill the diagonally up and right square one step at a time. 
If we encounter a filled square, move vertically down one square. 
Then we continue as before until we fill the entire matrix. 
Note that when an “up and right” or “down” move may wrap around to the last row, first column, or first row.

The following figure illustrates how to fill a five-by-five matrix if we start from a position (1, 2). 
Note that the index of the matrix is from 0 to $N$ - 1, from top to down, from left to the right.

Now we have the size of matrix $N$ and the position (x, y) of an integer k. Write a program to construct the magic square. 

## Input Format ##
There are four integers $N, k, x$, and $y$ in a line.
* $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
* $1 \leq k \leq N$
* $0 \leq x, y < N$


## Output Format ##
Print the magic square.

## Subtask ##
* 90 points: $k = 1$.
* 10 points: $k \leq N$.
