## Task Description
Write a program to place pieces on a chessboard. 
For simplicity, we consider only three types of pieces, *Queen*, *Bishop*, and *Rook*. 

- A queen can attack any squares along a row, a column, or diagonally.
- A bishop can attack any squares diagonally.
- A rook can attack any squares along a row or column.

![The moving rules of each piece](50200.png)

Initially, there are some stones on the chessboard.
We place pieces on the chessboard one at a time, then the squares that the piece attacks, and the square we place the piece, turn into stones.
Note that a piece cannot attack the squares behind the existing stones on the chessboard.


## SubTask
- 30 points: There is only one piece in each subtask.
- 70 points: You need to consider all types of pieces.

## Input Format

The first line has the height $h$ and width $w$ of the chessboard. 
Both $h$ and $w$ are positive and no more than 500.
Each of the remaining lines has the type of input and its position.
Type 0 are stones, 1 for the queens, 2 for the bishops, and 3 for the rooks.
Then the line has the column and the row indices of the square we will place it.
Columns are from left to right, and the rows are from top to the bottom.
You need to process all inputs until EOF.
Note that all stones will appear *before* the pieces.

## Output Format

Print the chessboard.
Print 1 for the stones and 0 for the empty squares.
