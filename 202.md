## Task Description ##

Write a program to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two mixed fractions. 
You will be given two mixed fractions -- $a \dfrac{b}{c}$ and $e \dfrac{f}{g}$. 
For example, if $a = 1$, $b = 3$, and $c = 4$, then you have 1.75. 
You can also represent negative number by a negative $a$, so if $a = -1$, $b = 3$, and $c = 4$, then the result is -1.75. 
For simplicity we assume that $a$ and $e$ are always non-zero, $b$ and $f$ are always non-negative, and $c$ and $g$ are always positive. 
Also, $b$ and $c$ have to be simplified. 
For example, you cannot have $a = 1$, $b = 6$, and $c = 8$. Also when $b$ or $f$ is 0, $c$ and $g$ must be 1. 
We will be given an extra number $d$ as the operator. 
If $d$ is 0, 1, 2, 3, then the operation is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. 
Now given $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$, compute the final result as a mixed fraction $h \dfrac{i}{j}$.

## Limits ##

The ranges of numbers are as follow. 
$a$ and $e$ are non-zero and between -100 and 100 inclusively. 
$b$, and $f$ are non-negative and no more than 100. 
$c$ and $g$ are positive and no more than 100. $d$ is always between 0 and 3 inclusively.

## Input ##

$a, b, c, d, e, f, g$

## Output ##

The output follows the same rules as the input. 
You should output $h$, $i$, and $j$ in three lines.
